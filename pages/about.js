                  I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics and
                  several projects in javascript development from modern mobile
                  to web applications in React and Nextjs.

                  Throughout my career, I have acquired advanced technical
                  knowledge and the ability to explain programming topics
                  clearly and in detail to a broadÂ audience. I invite you to
                  take my course, where I have put a lot of effort to explain
                  web and software engineering concepts in a detailed, hands-on
                  and understandable way.
